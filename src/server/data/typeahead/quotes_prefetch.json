    "It is my art. I am better at it than I ever was. And I will do it as long as I can. When you reach a certain age you can slough off what is unnecessary and concentrate on what is. And why not? - Arthur Miller",

    "The idea of regretting not doing this seemed insane to me. Sitting in the corner at a bar at age 60, saying: 'I could've been Bond. Buy me a drink.' That's the saddest place I could be. At least now at 60 I can say: 'I was Bond. Now buy me a drink.' - Daniel Craig",

    "We tried not to age, but time had its rage. - Patti Smith",

    "With the song 'This Christmas' I wanted to do something that was kind of different. I mean, Donny Hathaway is an amazing artist. So I wanted to bring my flavor to the song so when people over the age of 45 or 50 hear it they'll be like 'OK, he did his thing with that record.' It's like I can appeal to everybody and not just a younger demographic. - Chris Brown",

    "At my age the only problem is with remembering names. When I call everyone darling, it has damn all to do with passionately adoring them, but I know I'm safe calling them that. Although, of course, I adore them too. - Richard Attenborough",
    "What I really tried to do with Helen was make her show this sad side of her. She was married off at 16, was so young and living in this castle that can't leave because of how she looks, and married to a man she hates and three times her age. - Diane Kruger",

    "I never took guitar lessons. I took classical piano lessons from the age of six when we lived in Holland. - Eddie Van Halen",

    "I'm 20 years old. I like to party as much as anyone my age. Going clubbing is my way of relaxing or releasing a lot of stress. I don't feel that I should have to justify that part of my life. I don't know that I'm necessarily an addict. - Lindsay Lohan",

    "At a young age, I was interested in comic books, which was really how I learnt to read. The name Cage came from a comic book character called Power Man. - Nicolas Cage",

    "I can't wait to be that age and hanging out with a bunch of people hanging out all day playing golf and going to the beach, all my own age. We'd be laughing and having a good time and getting loopy on our prescription drugs. Driving golf carts around. I can't wait. - Cameron Diaz",
    "I would love a family. I'm at the age where the wish for a child gets stronger. But who knows. - Cameron Diaz",
    "I love physical kinds of comedy and getting down and dirty and doing stunts. When I was growing up, I was always getting into fights with guys and usually punching out boys my age because I was a lot bigger and tougher. So I'm naturally accustomed to putting myself into the headspace of a girl who can take care of herself. - Cameron Diaz",
    "Love, with very young people, is a heartless business. We drink at that age from thirst, or to get drunk it is only later in life that we occupy ourselves with the individuality of our wine. - Isak Dinesen",
    "Age for me is just a number. - Haile Gebrselassie",
    "You hit a certain age and - especially because of TV - the young cooks coming up say, 'You're a sellout, because you're doing something other than what you should be doing.' 'Top Chef' is a double-edged sword for me: There's a whole group of people who will not come to the restaurants because they assume I'm not in them anymore, all I do is TV. - Tom Colicchio",
    "Some of your teachers are actually closer in age to you than you think. - Maya Lin",

    "As a precocious teen I dreamed of being Graham Greene. Well, as it turned out, I never wrote a great novel, sadly, and I never converted to Catholicism, happily, but I did do one thing he did. That is, in middle age I moved to a seaside town and got into a right barney with the local powers-that-be. - Julie Burchill",
    "Age should not have its face lifted, but it should rather teach the world to admire wrinkles as the etchings of experience and the firm line of character. - Clarence Day",

    "To me, old age is always fifteen years older than I am. - Bernard Baruch",

    "Maybe it is something to do with age, but I have become fonder of poetry than of prose. - Aung San Suu Kyi",
    "When I was younger, my whole sense of self-worth was based on whether or not I was working, which was awful. And I had a baby at 20 years old, so it wasn't just about me.

    "My habit would have been to veer towards the dark - to prove I was something edgy, or maybe to prove that I was cognisant of the dark side. Now, with age and confidence, I can say, yeah, that's true, but I am cognisant of the fact that people can do things well. And can be more loving than you expect. - George Saunders",
    "It is not possible to live in this age if you don't have a sense of many contradictory forces. - Rem Koolhaas",

    "You need some insecurity if you're an actor. It keeps the pot boiling. I haven't yet started to think about retiring. I was shocked when I heard about Paul Newman retiring at age 82. Most actors just fade away like old soldiers. - Al Pacino",
    "It's hard for women at my age in Hollywood, but I'm not discouraged. - Jane Fonda",
    "We're still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch. That's the old metaphor: You're born, you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude. - Jane Fonda",

    "The reality is sobering: in the United States one in three girls will become pregnant before age 20, totaling more than 750,000 girls per year. - Jane Fonda",

    "There are a lot of downsides to being male. We age faster and die younger. But give us this: we're lifetime baby-making machines. Women's reproductive abilities start to wane when they're as young as 35. Men? We're good to go pretty much till we're dead. - Jeffrey Kluger",
    "Older fatherhood isn't all bad: testosterone rates drop about 1% per year as men age, making them less reactive and more patient, and a professionally established middle-aged man is likely to have more time and money to devote to his kids than a twenty-something who's just getting started. - Jeffrey Kluger",
    "Credit or debit cards, for starters, are nothing short of shoppers' Novocain. Even in the age of digital purchases and virtual money, we still attach a special value to dirty paper with pictures of presidents on it. Handing some of that to a cashier simply hurts more than handing over a little sliver of plastic. - Jeffrey Kluger",
    "When it comes to raising civilized kids there are no hard rules, but there are two things on which most parents agree: Boys are generally wilder than girls, and adolescents are wilder than kids of any other age. If you've got an adolescent boy, you're in the sweet spot for trouble. - Jeffrey Kluger",

    "It begins and ends with money. It's absurd in this day and age when we need so much money for education, health, for people, that a $100 million dollars can be spent on a film. It's obscene. - Kathleen Turner",
    "I am at that age when you panic at the slightest thing. - Rupert Everett",
    "Being gay and being a woman has one big thing in common, which is that we both become invisible after the age of 42. Who wants a gay 50-year-old? No one, let me tell you. - Rupert Everett",

    "I began to understand my sensations, to know what I wanted, at around the age of forty - but only vaguely. - Camille Pissarro",
    "I grew up on a farm in a small town where you do or say one thing and everybody knows about it.

So I learned at a very young age just to keep my mouth shut. - Garrett Hedlund",

    "Old age is not a disease - it is strength and survivorship, triumph over all kinds of vicissitudes and disappointments, trials and illnesses. - Maggie Kuhn",
