Facebook - Log In Integration
-----------------------------

1. Use the ezeeideas@gmail.com Facebook account for managing all keys
2. Have separate Facebook Apps for Dev, Stage and Production accounts (each with separate Client IDs and Client Secrets)
3. Store the Client ID and Client Secret values in the .env file in the src/server folder on each system manually - NOTE: THIS FILE IS NOT CHECKED IN!
4. In the developer.facebook.com/apps page, log in with ezeeideas@gmail.com account, and navigate to the individual app page
5. Make sure to set the App Domain to the root URL (e.g., https://localhost:8080, or https://stage.captionify.com, or https://www.captionify.com)
6. Make sure to set the Privacy Policy URL (can use same URL for each): https://www.captionify.com/pages/privacy.html
7. Add Product for Facebook Login if not already, and add the Valid OAuth Redirect URL to the actual URL (e.g., https://localhost:8080/auth/facebook/callback, or https://stage.captionify.com/auth/facebook/callback, or https://www.captionify.com/auth/facebook/callback)
8. Make sure to make the App Public
9. This should be sufficient to "log in with Facebook" - test it on each environment
